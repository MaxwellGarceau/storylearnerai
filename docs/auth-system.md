# Authentication System

## Overview

This application uses Supabase for user authentication.

- Sign up, sign in, and session management are provided by Supabase Auth
- Client configuration uses `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` and `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
- Protected pages are gated with `ProtectedRoute`

For Supabase setup details, see `supabase-setup.md`.
