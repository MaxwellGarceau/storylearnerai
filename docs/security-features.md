# Security Features

This document outlines the comprehensive security measures implemented in the StoryLearnerAI application, with particular focus on input sanitization and XSS prevention.

## Overview

The application implements a multi-layered security approach to protect against common web vulnerabilities, especially focusing on the text input areas where users can enter stories for translation.

## Input Sanitization System

### Core Sanitization Utility

Located at `src/lib/utils/sanitization.ts`, this utility provides comprehensive text sanitization capabilities:

#### Key Features

- **DOMPurify Integration**: Uses the industry-standard DOMPurify library for HTML sanitization
- **Configurable Options**: Flexible sanitization options for different use cases
- **Real-time Validation**: Immediate feedback on potentially dangerous content
- **Length Limits**: Configurable maximum input lengths to prevent resource exhaustion

#### Main Functions

```typescript
// Sanitize text with default story options
sanitizeStoryText(input: string): string

// Validate text input and return detailed results
validateStoryText(input: string): {
  isValid: boolean;
  errors: string[];
  sanitizedText: string;
}
```

### Security Threats Prevented

#### 1. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

**Threat**: Malicious scripts injected through text input
**Prevention**: 
- Strips all `<script>` tags and their content
- Removes event handlers (`onclick`, `onerror`, etc.)
- Blocks JavaScript protocol URLs (`javascript:`)
- Handles nested and encoded script tags

**Example**:
```javascript
// Input: <script>alert('xss')</script>Hello world
// Output: Hello world
```

#### 2. HTML Injection

**Threat**: Unwanted HTML tags that could break layout or inject content
**Prevention**:
- By default, strips all HTML tags
- Optional whitelist for safe HTML tags when needed
- Preserves text content while removing markup

#### 3. Data URL Attacks

**Threat**: Malicious data URLs that could execute code
**Prevention**:
- Blocks `data:text/html` URLs
- Prevents iframe injection through data URLs

#### 4. Event Handler Injection

**Threat**: Event handlers that could execute malicious code
**Prevention**:
- Removes all `on*` attributes
- Handles various event handler patterns

### Configuration Options

The sanitization system supports flexible configuration:

```typescript
interface SanitizationOptions {
  allowHTML?: boolean;           // Default: false
  allowLineBreaks?: boolean;     // Default: true
  maxLength?: number;           // Default: 10000
  trim?: boolean;               // Default: true
  allowedTags?: string[];       // Custom allowed HTML tags
  allowedAttributes?: string[]; // Custom allowed HTML attributes
}
```

## FullPageStoryInput Component Security

### Real-time Validation

The `FullPageStoryInput` component implements real-time security validation:

1. **Input Monitoring**: Every keystroke is validated for security threats
2. **Immediate Feedback**: Users see security warnings in real-time
3. **Automatic Sanitization**: Malicious content is automatically removed
4. **Translation Prevention**: Translation is blocked until security issues are resolved

### User Experience Features

#### Security Warning Display

When malicious content is detected:
- Red warning banner appears below the input
- Clear explanation of the security issue
- Assurance that content has been automatically sanitized
- Guidance on how to fix the input

#### Graceful Degradation

- Users can continue editing even with security warnings
- Sanitized content is preserved for editing
- Translation is only blocked when active threats are present

### Implementation Details

```typescript
const handleInputChange = (event: React.ChangeEvent<HTMLTextAreaElement>) => {
  const rawValue = event.target.value;
  
  // Validate and sanitize the input
  const validation = validateStoryText(rawValue);
  
  if (validation.isValid) {
    setValidationError(null);
    onChange(validation.sanitizedText);
  } else {
    setValidationError(validation.errors[0]);
    onChange(validation.sanitizedText); // Still use sanitized version
  }
};
```

## Testing Strategy

### Comprehensive Test Coverage

The security features are thoroughly tested with:

1. **Unit Tests**: `src/lib/utils/__tests__/sanitization.test.ts`
   - 31 test cases covering all sanitization scenarios
   - Edge cases and performance testing
   - Security threat simulation

2. **Component Tests**: `src/components/story/__tests__/FullPageStoryInput.security.test.tsx`
   - 12 test cases for component security features
   - User interaction testing
   - Real-time validation testing

### Test Categories

#### Sanitization Tests
- Null/undefined input handling
- HTML tag stripping
- Script tag removal
- Event handler detection
- Length limit enforcement

#### Security Threat Tests
- XSS script injection attempts
- JavaScript protocol attacks
- Event handler injection
- Data URL attacks
- Complex nested attacks

#### User Experience Tests
- Normal text handling
- Special character preservation
- Warning display and clearing
- Translation prevention

## Performance Considerations

### Efficient Processing

- **Lazy Evaluation**: Validation only runs when input changes
- **Optimized Patterns**: Efficient regex patterns for threat detection
- **Length Limits**: Prevents resource exhaustion from extremely large inputs
- **Memory Management**: Proper cleanup of sanitized content

### Scalability

- **Configurable Limits**: Adjustable maximum input lengths
- **Modular Design**: Easy to extend with new security rules
- **Reusable Components**: Sanitization utilities can be used across the app

## Best Practices

### For Developers

1. **Always Use Sanitization**: Never trust user input directly
2. **Test Security Features**: Run security tests before deployment
3. **Monitor for New Threats**: Keep security patterns updated
4. **Document Changes**: Update this document when adding new security features

### For Users

1. **Trust the Warnings**: Security warnings indicate real threats
2. **Follow Guidance**: Fix input when security issues are detected
3. **Report Issues**: Contact support if legitimate content is blocked

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Security Features

1. **Content Security Policy (CSP)**: Additional browser-level protection
2. **Rate Limiting**: Prevent abuse through excessive input
3. **Advanced Threat Detection**: Machine learning-based threat detection
4. **Audit Logging**: Track security events for analysis

### Monitoring and Analytics

1. **Security Event Tracking**: Monitor blocked threats
2. **Performance Metrics**: Track sanitization performance
3. **User Feedback**: Collect feedback on false positives

## Compliance and Standards

### OWASP Guidelines

The security implementation follows OWASP (Open Web Application Security Project) guidelines:

- **A03:2021 - Injection**: Prevented through input sanitization
- **A07:2021 - Identification and Authentication Failures**: Not applicable to public input
- **A08:2021 - Software and Data Integrity Failures**: Prevented through validation

### Industry Standards

- **DOMPurify**: Industry-standard HTML sanitization library
- **Content Security Policy**: Planned implementation
- **Secure Coding Practices**: Following TypeScript/React best practices

## Conclusion

The StoryLearnerAI application implements robust security measures to protect users from common web vulnerabilities. The multi-layered approach ensures that malicious content is detected and prevented while maintaining a smooth user experience.
