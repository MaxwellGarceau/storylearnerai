      "verb_conjugation": "Use only the Present Tense ('Presente de Indicativo'). Focus on high-frequency regular -ar verbs. Limit conjugations to the most essential forms: first person ('yo'), second person informal ('tú'), and third person ('él/ella/usted').",
      "ser_vs_estar": "AVOID using both 'ser' and 'estar' in the same story. Use 'ser' for permanent characteristics ('el coche es rojo') OR 'estar' for location ('el coche está en la calle'). Do not mix.",
      "adjective_agreement": "Adjectives must follow the noun they modify. Only use adjectives that end in '-o' or '-e' to keep agreement simple. Example: 'El perro es blanco.' 'La casa es grande.' AVOID adjectives requiring more complex gender changes for now."
